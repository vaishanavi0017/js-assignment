JavaScript Essentials Day 3-1


Question 1
Explore and explain the various methods in console function?

Ans. In javascript, the console is an object which provides access to the browser debugging console. The console object provides us with several different methods, like :log(),error(),warn(),clear(),time() and timeEnd()
1.console.log():This function used to print or log the output to the console. It can take any type inside it like a string, an array or any object.
Eg: console.log("Hey"), will return Hey as the output on the console.
   console.log(true), will return the Boolean value true on the console.
2.console.error():It is used to log an error to the console. This is useful for testing the code for some big projects.
Eg: console.error("an error occured!"),will give an error message with an by default red color highlighted message.
3.console.warn():Warn function is used to give a warning message to the user on console.
Eg: console.warn("Hey this is a warning!!"), this function will return the warning message on the console with a yellow color by default.
4.console.clear():This function clears the console. Depending on the browser, a message will be generated to show that the console has been cleared.
Eg:console.clear()
5.console.time() and timeEnd():To count the amount of time taken to complete a block of code or a piece of code from the entire code this method is be used. The time and timeEnd function should take the same label to count the time.
  Eg: console.time(“Time taken”);
       console.log("Hey")
       console.warn("Hey this is a warning!!")
      console.timeEnd(“Time Taken”);this will retuen the time taken for the above code with  the label as Time Taken.
6.console.table(): This method allows us to generate a table inside a console. The input must be an array or an object which will be shown as a table.




Question 2
Write the difference between var, let and const with code examples.

1.var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped.
2.var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
3.They are all hoisted to the top of their scope but while varvariables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.
4.While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration
Examples
1.var
function f1(){
    var a =5;
    console.log(5);  // output 5
    if(true){
     var a=2;
     console.log(2); // output 2
    }
    console.log(2);  // output 2
  }
2.let
function f2(){
    let a =10;
    console.log(a);  // output 10
    if(true){
     let a=20;
     console.log(a); // output 20
    }
    console.log(a);  // output 10
  }
3.const
function f3(){
    const MY_VARIABLE =10;
    console.log(MY_VARIABLE);  //output 10
    MY_VARIABLE =20;           //throws type error
    console.log(MY_VARIABLE); 
  }



Question 3
Write a brief intro on available datatypes in Javascript


In JavaScript there are two different kinds of data: primitives, and objects. A primitive is simply a data type that is not an object, and has no methods.
Primitive
In JS, there are six primitive data types:
1.Boolean:A boolean represents only one of two values: true, or false.
2.Number: Numbers can be written with or without a decimal point.
3.String:Strings are used for storing text,and are immutable.
4.Null:Null has one value: null. It is explicitly nothing.
5.Undefined:A variable that has no value is undefined.
6.Symbol:A Symbol is an immutable primitive value that is unique. 

Objects
Objects are not a primitive data Type.
An object is a collection of properties. These properties are stored in key/value pairs. Properties can reference any type of data, including objects and/or primitive values.
